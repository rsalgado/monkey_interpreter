# Monkey Language Interpreter - JS
This is a Javascript translation of the interpreter of the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

In order to run the REPL, run:
```
node repl/repl.js
```

The directory structure, the tests and the code were written to be close to the original code in Go, although I took some liberties and implemented some pieces differently.
I barely added comments or documentation as I was mostly following the book and adapting the code to Javascript.

**This project was only done for learning purposes.**
